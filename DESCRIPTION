Description: 
    The ovsa package implements a method for conducting sensitivity analysis. 
    Imputation is a common technique for addressing missing data; however, 
    when working with real data, the MCAR (Missing Completely at Random) 
    and MAR (Missing At Random) assumptions may not accurately reflect the true
    mechanisms behind the missing data. Therefore, it can be beneficial 
    to consider the MNAR (Missing Not At Random) mechanism and use a 
    sensitivity analysis approach to evaluate deviations from MAR. This method applies the 
    algorithm *Dioni et al.,2024* (Sensitivity Analysis 
    Method in the Presence of a Missing Not at Random Ordinal Independent Variable).
    The package can be applied in both non-hierarchical  and hierarchical contexts,
    with a binary response. However, the method should be used with caution, as it 
    heavily relies on the assumption that certain specific (overrepresented) categories
    of an ordinal variable tend to be missing.
